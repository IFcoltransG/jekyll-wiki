# Wiki
This is the repo for a Jekyll wiki, based on the Digital Garden Jekyll Template. To set up your own wiki, you may need to change the baseurl and url to your hosting solution in `_config.yml`, as well as the edit base url.

You can see a [demo of the site here](https://ifcoltransg.github.io/jekyll-wiki/).
